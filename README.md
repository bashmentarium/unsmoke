# Unsmoke
App meant to help people overcome the tobacco addiction

  Unsmoke is meant to help you overcome difficulties on your path to a smoke-free life and gain control over the process of smoking. 

  Built a mobile app with exercises, tips and nlp techniques that help people overcome the tobacco addiction.
The app has the simplest design possible.

The main challenges of the project were:
- Build a mobile app for both major platforms
- Authenticate users with firebase
- Securely store user profiles in a database

The project was made entirely from scratch, including the appâ€™s design and appearance.
